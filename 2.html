        Your name is Peter, but online you go by <kbd>forpetessake</kbd>. You are in an open world sandbox game called <strong>Sandboxed</strong>.  This is your first time playing a game like this, and to be honest you are <strong>a little scared</strong>. Is it supposed to be this dark when you start the game?
